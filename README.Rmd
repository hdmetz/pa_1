# Summary of observations

# The 'hablo' and 'habló' duration has a difference of 89 (ms), as well as an [o] duration difference of 36 (ms). The intensity difference in dB is 2.735 between [o] and [ó], which makes sense considering the accented syllable. There is also a difference in frequency in Hz of -2.869 for the accented syllable.
