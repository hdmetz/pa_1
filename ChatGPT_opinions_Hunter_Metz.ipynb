Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/ChatGPT) if you have any questions or concerns.*\", \"I work as a teacher, and I'm involved heavily in adjusting for AI in my region. \\n\\nWe're shifting tasks to focus on reflection of learning, and critical explanation of planning and understanding, as opposed to just regurgitating info. \\n\\nEducation will change, but AI really just requires people to be more critical/creative and less rote\\n\\nEdit: Yes, this is how teaching should have always been. Good teachers won't need to change much, less effective teachers will panic. \\n\\nAlso AI can write reflections, but by the time you input enough information specific to the reflection that ties in class based discussion and activities, it takes as long to design the prompt as it does to just do the reflection. I had my kids even do this once, and most hated it as it took more effort than just writing it themselves. The thing is to have specific guiding reflection statements not just 'reflect on thos work'. A lot of people seem to think that because AI can do something, it can do it easy. To get an essay to an A level for my literary students it took them over three hours. Most of them could have written it in an hour. Even then they need to know the text, understand the core analysis component, and know the quotes used to even begin to get a passable prompt.\", 'Were the citations hallucinations?', \"If it helps you feel better, I use chatGPT as my personal tutor and it does a better job at helping me understand what I'm studying.\", \"Make sure to double check the references :-) GPT3.5 just made up references when I last tried. GPT4 is maybe better. GPT3.5 just kept on making up stuff, even when I told it the references didn't exist.\", '\"You didn\\'t learn a damn thing\"\\n\\nDid you really tho?\\n\\nMost the thing I learned in university are useless to me in my current jobs, the main thing I learn that was important in my job was how to google stuff.\\n\\nI graduated in 2007 so I never used ChatGPT for school, but since ChatGPT is out now, I spent the last few months using it to learn to automate all my task at work, prior to ChatGPT I used Google search like I learned in university, the main difference now is ChatGPT allow me to do thing I used to do using google but 100x faster and better.\\n\\nBasically, I think Google, ChatGPT, etc are just tools, like axes, chainsaws etc, they will produce something for you and its up to you to know what to do with them.', 'I agree with OP. The teaching method needs to change, not the way students deliver their work. As Charlie Munger put it, \"Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome\"', \"It's a tool like a calculator. For 20 years through school, I was told we can't use X-tool for a test or other work. \\n\\nNow in professional work, everybody uses as many tools as possible to save time and money and get same or better quality work.\\n\\nHell, I'm crafting a business presentation about AI that I'm crafting only with ChatGPT. The skill is in knowing how/what you want to do, describing that well, then refining and editing the input/output into something relevant and coherent for yourself to tell an audience. \\n\\nOnce I've got the content down, I'll feed it into an AI presentation maker, and boom - potential contract.\", \"I feel like we need to re-evaluate the point of education. People forget that the point of paying thousands upon thousands of dollars for an education is to *learn* something, not to just get a diploma at the end of it. If you're paying that much to learn *and* avoiding the chance to learn, something is broken. \\n\\nIt's dumb that the school has to be policing this in the first place. Their entire job should be to give you the tools to learn what's needed out there. They shouldn't have to give a damn if you decide to do something with the tools or not. The whole system has made it so that the incentives are ass-backwards. That people think they need the diploma for the job and not the actual education. \\n\\nSo schools will continue trying to protect the integrity of the diploma instead of changing anything.\", 'I think you said the quiet part out loud, \"delivering a presentation on a topic you don\\'t care about\".\\n\\nThe education systems around the world are riddled with unnecessary garbage in each curriculum, spanning as wide as having to take an elective about \"wine appreciation\" in a business course.\\n\\nSo yes, use gpt against them.\\n\\nIf it was something you were passionate about, would you have use gpt to write it, or to help you go deeper and innovate? If the answer is still gpt on both fronts, then maybe I agree with your hypothesis.', 'Poorly constructed assessments will be forced to changed. This is gonna be a great forced change for education. \\n\\nEducators are going to have to think about how to assess students in a whole different way. One that actually assesses a students knowledge and critical thinking of a topic.', 'I failed my first masters student last week for using AI generated citations that didn’t exist, and when it came to their Viva they failed the verbal critical reflection component of their talk.\\n\\nWe’re all aware of it and it’s likely that future assessment is going to rely far more on vivas, in-person demonstration and explanation, and document submission is going to be weighted far lower.\\n\\nTo be honest a masters group presentation to present a topic is fairly weak as a learning outcome. If this was just a component of a module fair enough, but in the masters courses I’ve taught involving group work, the outcomes have always involved real participant testing, client management, or the creation of tools/artefacts (which admittedly can be somewhat generated, but not fully). The only other modules I’ve seen that have a weaker presentation component are the research methods modules which are designed as foundation/fundamental tasks for the rest of the masters course, but aren’t that challenging. Granted, I’ve only taught in MSc and observed in Health Masters, so I don’t know about courses outside those fields.', \"We're going to have to go back to hand-written essays written in class in blue books.\", 'University faculty is full of one thing, researchers. There are committies already formed and meeting, divising policies and strategies for: inclusion, detection, and management.\\nThere are applications for AI that are going to be embraced and included in lessons and even assignments. They will seek a balance where the benefits of AI can be enjoyed but the quality of the education they provide in class and across the university as a whole retains its value.\\nThere is a serious concern for the effects AI has on students. For instance, if AI is used continuously in the construction and writing of papers, this precludes the student from using and building their analytical and reasoning skills. This is even a greater concern for students in middle school that begin to use ChatGPT at a younger age, the impact will also be more profound on their thought processes. \\nYou could effectively become a slave to AI and unable to accomplish without it, AI becomes a crutch that becomes necessary.', 'That just shows how little effort school has put in all these years trying to \"teach\". Getting students to do meaningless tasks etc. Welp, I guess now it\\'s time to get my master\\'s now too.', \"I'm in a graduate-level course where the prof is doing research on generative AI (not the topic of the course)-- she has said we are free to use it in our assignments and won't be graded down, but we must note how we used it and for what. I think this is an interesting take!\", 'I fed chatGPT the video transcript for a video highlighting the features, functionality, and use cases of a new tool Atlassian just released. I then asked it to create a phased product adoption plan for my organization, create objectives and key results for each phase, and create the documentation needed for the communication and roll out plans. \\n\\nIt did all of this with flying colors on data it was not trained on, just the content of a 7 minute youtube video. I am a bit of a subject matter expert for my organization for our Atlassian toolstack and this would have taken me weeks to put together. I did it in about 2 hours in total, including making a training program for our users. If you cant beat em, join em.', '\"I cheated and got the full mark. I\\'m alarmed about higher education\".', 'School is greatly flawed that memorization and regurgitation of that memory is considered smart/right.  The AI advancements are making it more clear that spewing back known solutions is not smart.\\n\\nWe need to switch to curriculums that reward unique thought and problem solving.  The ability to have an answer to a known question is now far to trivial.  Majority of adults have dumped a large amount of the knowledge they were forced to memorize in school once they are older.\\n\\nEducation needs to change to show students how much faster they can work and create by leveraging AI.  Being able to write the 20 millionth cookie cutter paper on To Kill A Mockingbird isnt advancing society anywhere…\\n\\nA 5th grader could leverage chatgpt to build an entire video game by just speaking.  School will be far more interesting if teachers embrace this.  Great a new game entirely from scratch.  Write a 100 page book.

Don't know or really care about other disciplines. ChatGPT won't replace learning and the problem is elsewhere, namely, stupid grading systems that allow this kind of loophole.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI don't see this as alarming as you do (as everyone, the media, and  public opinion actually does). At the Master's level, presentations are  nothing but a general-purpose, organized list of facts and how they  interact with one another. I am currently enrolled in a Master's program  (MSc) in Europe, and the presentations I get to do are kind of boring  too. If ChatGPT does well in them, well, that's just the way it goes.  It's good at that. But, other than for novel-research presentations with  truly groundbreaking, new results, presentations don't tell us anything  about the in-depth, core-skills-related abilities of students. For science specifically, maths and physics for example, there's no way it'll be as relevant as looking up and reading articles. So what?  ChatGPT did the presentation, but it won't be passing the hardest exams  yet (apart from seemingly basic things that can be pretty well  approximated by language, like coding and small reasoning).  However, the  latest research articles still show that these large language models  critically lack critical thinking, understanding of the world, and  planning. They are still prone to errors and so on.\\n\\nNever forget that language models are nothing but language. But real human thoughts and reasoning are far more advanced than language. It works only because they throw hundreds of billions of neurons at the problem and that's basically overkill.\\n\\nThere's currently a euphoria going on about the multiples roles/jobs that chatGPT could replace. While it's true that some of these tasks can genuinely be, it can't do the job of *learning* for you. If you got the best mark achievable, the problem is rather the grading system and you teacher allowing for such dumb, uninformative evaluated tasks such as this presentation.\\n\\nSo, actually, ChatGPT and other related tools won't really  bring added value to students' presentations. They're really just fancy,  high-tech summarizers for common knowledge.\", 'Ironically, I bet you learned a lot more than you did before about the subject, just from the presentation it generated for you. \\n\\nI actually find that GPT is one of the best education tools for quickly helping to learn fundamental info about almost any topic.

Learning and certificates (diplomas, degrees, marks etc.). The certificates are like a currency. They are quite scarce and you need the resource as an \"entrance fee\" for good positions. It is important to protect the certificates, to give them some meaning of justice and fairness, connected with the idea that everyone has the same fair chance, you just have to work and who works most gets the best grade etc. Work also means learning in this story. Who has learned best gets the best grade etc.\\n\\nIn my point of view this story doesn\\'t really fit. You can learn a lot and get a bad grade, you can hardly learn and get a good one. Some people have resources like money, parents who are from academia, the right social background... Some people don\\'t have those resources at all. They have to do a lot more. So for me, learning and certificates can be seen as different disconnected things. (But to keep the higher education system running... and that is also about a lot of money, you have to keep this story up)\\n\\nLearning is about following a point of interest, working out and overcoming a problem you really want to solve. \\nThere is a form of defensive learning where you \"learn\" to avoid punishment (getting expelled, bad marks,...). But the form of learning where you evolve as a person, become better, etc. (That form of learning that supports our society so to say) is only possible if you really want it.\\n\\nSo, I think you cheated the system for the certificate but you also cheated yourself for the learning. You got nothing out of it except the grade. But as you already said that you couldn\\'t care less for the topic.. you wouldn\\'t have learned without the cheating. So, you saved time that you invested hopefully in something more meaningful for you. You cheated a system that wanted to force you to \"learn\" something you couldn\\'t care less about.\\nFrom a humanist perspective: perfect. You cheated an unfair system to get more meaningful time for yourself!\\n\\nThe certificate system has a problem because AI is dangerous to the story.

You need to be able to question and challenge ideas, not just regurgitate them. And this is where AI falls short.\\n\\nAI can provide you with a wealth of information, but it cannot replace human thinking and analysis. It cannot teach you how to think critically, how to question assumptions, or how to evaluate evidence.

Take the time to read and analyze articles, and use AI as a tool to supplement your own thinking, not as a substitute for it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while AI is undoubtedly a powerful tool, it cannot replace the human capacity for critical thinking and analysis.

Its relevance is a bit oblique, but here's the part I was thinking of:\\n\\n> Let’s suppose you want the latest iPad. You want it because it is convenient to be able to look at pictures and websites and books and play music around the house. Sure, you already have other computers that do those things, but the iPad is special because it lets you do them while holding it in one hand, sitting on the couch.\\n\\n> Wow, that couch is pretty convenient too, isn’t it? It is comfortable, enjoyable, convenient, and joyful to sit and lie on your couch. In fact, wouldn’t it be best to just lie on that couch all day? Forever? Yeah! Maybe you could even hook it up with a catheter and a bedpan, and a friend or robot could bring you all your food on the couch too. With each release, the latest iPad could be delivered to you, and you’d have the most convenient and comfortable and effort-free life ever.\\n\\n> Maybe you were with me for the first bit of that paragraph, but it probably lost its appeal by the time we reached the end, right? And indeed, with proper understanding, almost any consumer purchase (and almost any bad habit) these days, beyond the necessities, should start to sound like a catheter and a bedpan to you.\\n\\n> “I really like my Land Rover, and I deserve it because I’m a big executive now. It’s much faster than biking those five miles to work. Especially since I don’t want to arrive at work all sweaty”. Uh-huh. And it’s much more convenient than a compact hatchback, because you don’t have to bend your knees to get into the driver’s seat. And you no longer have to wait a whole ten seconds to accelerate to 60MPH, because it has a big enough engine to pull its enormous bulk to that speed in only six seconds. Would you, by any chance, like a catheter and a bedpan to go with that?\\n\\n> “I like running my A/C at 72 degrees, because it’s just so nice to come in out of the Texas heat into a fresh, cool house. Then I do the laundry and use my electric clothes dryer to get crisp, hot clothes ready to wear without all that hassle of hanging them up to dry”. Uh-huh. If only your clothes were equipped with catheters and bedpans, then you’d really be set, wouldn’t you!?\\n\\n> We could go on and on with this theme (and you’re welcome to do so in the comments, because I find it pretty funny). But the bottom line is, virtually everything we buy is actually a form of false happiness, a slippery slope that ends at the catheter and the bedpan, and the earlier on the slope that you catch yourself, the richer and happier you will be.\\n\\nThe post arrives at what is basically a celebration of doing the work and going through the difficulty:\\n\\n> Only by gaining control of your mind and the conveyor belt of false desires it serves up, can you get true freedom in your life. Freedom, unlike convenience, can really bring happiness. It’s a bit dizzying, and maybe even a bit difficult. But once again, it is the good kind of difficulty.\\n\\nI also think about a discussion in an education class that was a mix of upperclass undergraduates and graduate students, where one man, a little older than the class average, lamented how when he was younger he spent his time avoiding the work...and now he wished he had just done the work because he had a lot of catch up to be able to do what he needed to do.\\n\\nAs a writer, I've been playing with ChatGPT...and I'm scared about what it would do to my mind to feed it any substantial portion of my work.

Who pays for that? What if I only got 20% in one of these classes!?  The good schools that still focus on retention can get up to 60% graduating in 6 years.\\n\\nSo they hide a tuition scheme that milks an extra year or two of their ever expanding tuition costs. They fail more kids than graduate. They prey on young kids and unlimited student loans.

How can you accuse someone of cheating if you don’t even know what your students understand? \\n\\nI took a class that had to deal with programming languages and was going through different compiling theories and how to make our own programming language.

I didn’t want to spend hours of reading about a specific quirk in an older language and do an entire weeklong coding assignment just to highlight that quirk that doesn’t exist anywhere else. A whole week of instruction traded for an assignment that they wanted us to google all kinds of cobal questions.

When they leave for the day, the papers stay in my file cabinet. \\n\\nIt's ended up streamlining everything. Because this leaves less time for lectures, I've been forced to revisit my time-tested lectures to streamline them for time and content efficiency. Because all of their writing is in-class, procrastinating is a lot harder, plus I'm there to be a resource on time-management. I'm there to give live feedback on research and writing and I'm using more peer review which is helping people's critical skills. \\n\\nIn a weird way, this has made me a better teacher. For any teachers in a similar situation, I recommend outsmarting ChatGPT by going old-school. \\n____________________________________\\nThat said, I'm concerned that AI will benefit the 1% to the detriment of the 99% because of our capitalist socio-economic framework because the means of production are still with the economic ruling class. We're constantly moving in the opposite direction of having enough middle-class careers for everyone, careers which can keep pace with the cost of living, and I worry AI will be an accelerant to that trend. My students are looking at an increasingly dire future. \\n\\nIf you're a student now, I recommend considering worker organization as a large aspect of your career goals. Unless there's organization on a scale we've not seen in over a century, AI will be neither under your control nor to your benefit.\", \"You better stay anonymous....\\n\\nUniversities are cracking down on the use of AI - a lot now are saying if there's any evidence of use of chatGPT then you will just get a 0 mark.\\n\\nAs a researcher I suggest you DON'T do this again, if the uni finds out they may well just void your degree. It's effectively cheating, and whether or not you care about the subject of the presentation, part of doing a masters degree is having that drive to persevere through the stuff you don't enjoy as much. Cheating is academic misconduct and dealt with pretty seriously. If you don't want to do the work you shouldn't be doing the degree.\\n\\nHow will it be policed in the future? Assess knowledge in a moderated environment, set assignments that require unique solutions.\", \"Higher education has always been about gatekeeping certain career paths / levels of financial stability than it had actually providing an education. You CAN learn things during your education, but it's almost by accident and because of your own efforts, not because of the course work itself. For the most part, education teaches us how to memorize and regurgitate knowledge, not how to think. Learning is not actually compulsory as long as you can get past the gate they've erected to hold you back.\\n\\nWhen I was in university, three friends and I in the same major made sure we all took the same classes (though not necessarily all on the same day). Each of us was responsible for one of the classes  and did the full course work to the best of our ability. We provided that work to each of the other three along with all the detailed notes we took, so they could easily re-write, re-order, and otherwise slightly modify the content enough to be completely unrecognizable, but still of the highest quality, while only taking about a tenth of the time. The major was language and humanities based, so literally all of the assignments were essays. Rewriting the essays and reviewing the notes gave us more than enough exposed knowledge to understand the premise of all the assignments in case there was related material on the finals.\\n\\nIn the end, we all got straight A's for three years, all while doing less than a third of the actual work that should have been required. Nobody ever knew. What you guys did was essentially the same thing, except nobody had to put in ANY of the time we did to get there - which, frankly, I applaud.\\n\\nWork smart, not hard.\", 'You did learn something lol', \"No, you didn't.\", \"I'm a graduate student who will, all going well, one day be a professor. Our education system is based on a punitive model: Force the students to study what is deemed good for them and use a system of punishment (and reward) \\\\[grading\\\\] to make them do it. This model doesn't actually work very well because all real learning happens when people are genuinely curious and interested.   \\n\\n\\nThe advent of LLMs in the classroom will eventually force a transformation in pedagogy that centers the interests of the students and encouraging curiousity and studying for studying's sake. \\n\\nThere is value in doing things that we aren't intially interested in, as somethings require practice and dealing with discomfort to gain mastery. However, very little effort is made to teach people why they should actually care. I did well in school, as most subjects were easy for me, but found languages very hard. I didn't do my work and subsequently didn't learn french, despite taking it all middle school and high school. When I discovered in my 20s that learning spanish would open up worlds for me, I was able to learn -- a humbling process but one which led me to where I am today completely fluent.   \\n\\n\\nI think that a learner-centered pedagogy will become more dominant as it becomes clear that there is no way to determine from the outside whether students are actually doing the work. Ultimately positive, though it will be a pretty long adjustment period.\", \"The thing with studying at a tertiary level is that using AI to help you get good grades will only get you so far. Yes, you might graduate with a good GPA or classification, and that may get you a good entry level job (IF you're lucky), but at the end of the day unless you happen to live in Scotland or Scandinavia you will have paid out the arse for the privilege and you won't have learnt a thing, when you could have spent 3 or 4 years getting to the same place by getting in at the bottom rung of the ladder and got **paid** to do it.\\n\\nAnother thing I'll add is that the one thing AI won't be able to do for a long time (I don't think) is come up with original thought.

Chat-GPT didn\\'t invent laziness or cheating 😂😂.  Imo, you didn\\'t cheat. You just used your resources. \\n\\nIf you\\'re still concerned about the future, I am curious if there were any ways you used the time chat gpt saved you to improve your own learning experience/tailored your experience to how you as an individual work or understand the world?  \\n\\nAlso, I overall wouldn\\'t sweat it.

But still, I think that trying to \"contain the beast\" is placing a lot more onus than is right on GPT than the people who use it.  Again, the beasts of cheating and laziness have been around forever. Your learning is very much a reflection of what you put into the process and I think that this alarmed perspective is a symptom of systems of education that have forgotten how to properly instill the sense that learning has value in its constituents. Our curriculums are no longer thoughtful. Our methods of evaluating the effectiveness of teaching pedagogy have become outcome rather than process focused.  The skill it takes to make learning fun, engaging, and successful while adhering to the standards set by politicians and non teachers burns out our teaching force.  In the US, at least, teachers are some of the most underappreciated, overworked, underpaid members of our labor market.  This leads to burnout, as im sure you know. \\n\\nSpeaking of burnout: students are also burnt out, especially in higher academia.  I have observed how professors talk about student complaints in their subreddits, and, honestly, I think it shows how much students and teachers vilify each other when, in fact, we are all victims and stakeholders of a broken system that has failed us.  \\n\\nI hope chatGPT makes the load lighter on all of us.  I hope that the stakeholders in our educational systems are able to refocus on what\\'s important, which parts of the learning process work for them, and on using this tech to make learning accessible to more people.  \\n\\nI also hope that systemically speaking, we move away from learning models that derive their value from a readout of how many people it fails.  I\\'m excited for the ways chatGPT may be able to make learning more accessible for all who are interested in learning for the sake of learning.  I hope that the lesson we take from this holds chatGPT accountable as a symptom of how sick our educational systems have become.  \\n\\nI have other thoughts on how our educational gatekeeping traditions are also to blame for creating a circumstance where our reaction to such a mind-blowing, albeit disruptive, advance in educational science is one of horror and revulsion vs excitement and innovation.  These thoughts are a disorganized mess and probably not worth going into.   \\n\\nMy tldr; chatGPT is a calculator for language.  Calculators can be used to cheat, but good math and science teachers understand how calculators can be used to enhance learning.  Owning a calculator doesn\\'t mean people will cheat.  I also hope that chatGPT becomes accessible to all people and is not, instead, a reflection of class-based learning systems that reward the student with the most money.\\n\\nSorry if this annoys anyone.

Good teachers guide and motivate personally focused learning by asking the right questions and giving you ventures to explore that which interests you.

Even before AI, I always said people keep saying there is a \"STEM shortage\", but in my opinion we have much more of a shortage in terms of having people who can connect concepts across different subjects/domains using critical thinking.\\n\\nThis is one reason the pandemic response was so horrible: we have the silo approach, in which medical doctors know only within their own domain and did not know the basics related to viruses outside medicine, virologists knew about viruses but not the medical side, epidemiologists were good at statistical tracking of infection rates but not the medical side or the physics in in terms of how viruses can actually spread, etc... We have a lot of specialized people but a lot of these people actually lack basic logic and critical thinking unfortunately and don\\'t know more than the lay person when it comes to outside their highly narrow specialized field.

We’ll see how it goes.', \"Wait a minute.\\n\\nChatGPT didn't actually deliver the presentation for you? Literally unusable.\", 'I\\'m not the least bit worried. If the number of cheating students goes from 20% to 90%, that\\'s just fine. Universities will continue to get their money. When I was in school, instead of ChatGPT, there were fraternities. They would save decades of tests so that pledges could cram the night before, or just copy answers on a cheat sheet/whatever. Cheaters gonna cheat. What matters is when they go interview.\\n\\nNow, in fields where interviews are BS, the smoothest talkers will get the best jobs, because that\\'s how it\\'s always been. The degree just tells the interviewer whether you come from enough money to get legacy admissions or not. But in technical fields, cheating your way through school is not doing you any favors, because you won\\'t be able to pull up ChatGPT on a whiteboard. I realize that a lot of interviews are going virtual/online, where it is easier to cheat with an AI tool, but again, this will only get you so far. Cheating your way into a programming job is probably the stupidest possible thing you can do. The moment your team looks at your real code, they will know if you are a fraud or not. You can\\'t cheat your way through a software engineer career, because you will be dealing with million line codebases that evolved over 20 years, and you can\\'t feed thousands of lines of source code into ChatGPT so it can analyze it and tell you how to refactor key modules or make a change that spans 50+ source files.\\n\\nAt this point, you will either get fired, or you will get put in \"truck maintenance\", which means, the most undesirable team in the company, which gets no bonus pool at review time, no raises, no interesting projects, and is the first to lose headcount when staffing cuts roll around. The teams which are designed to manage people out of the company without firing them. If someone wants to spend $50-100k cheating their way through a 4 year degree to end up in this situation, I say let them. Not a single professor at that school has one iota of responsibility for detecting, let alone preventing such behavior. Professors should simply accept all homework and tests results as 100% authentic unless there is blatant and obvious copying/plagiarism.\\n\\nThe real problem is the manager who is overpaying. If you run a team and one of your workers is pulling a six figure salary for running a few ChatGPT scripts every few days, then you are a tool. You need to spy on that worker\\'s sessions until you understand exactly what they are doing, and then fire them, replacing them with 4 workers who can do the same thing at 1/4th the salary. Now you have 4x productivity, which you take to your boss and demand a raise/promotion. This is the process that will play out for every role that can be replaced with AI, because the managers who identify the freeloaders will cut the fat and keep it for themselves, and the ones who are asleep at the switch will get replaced by the vigilant and aggressive ones.\\n\\nSo yeah, AI is gonna take a lot of jobs, but will also create new ones. Like every tool ever invented, it will raise the bar for entry-level work. But just like the calculator did not make professional mathematicians obsolete, AI will not make humans obsolete. It will just elevate what they can accomplish, and what will then be expected of them. We no longer have lamplighters or rat catchers, but nobody has declared the end of civilization because these once widespread jobs have been wiped off the map. Now we have electricians and pest control experts who do the same functional job, but at a much higher level of technology and practice.\\n\\nThe same will be true of AI. Humans will still need to learn. The demand for university education will increase, rather than erode, just like it has been for the last several decades. If anything, the Master\\'s will become the new Bachelors, and we will have more Ph.Ds than ever. Only, Ph.Ds will be getting lucrative jobs rather than fighting over too few jobs in academia. Everything will get pushed higher. And cheaters? The only people they are cheating is themselves. That\\'s a problem that doesn\\'t even need to be solved. I interviewed hundreds of programmers at Fortune 500 companies, many coming from top-name schools, and I am absolutely certain that at least a few of them were exactly these cheaters who got a fancy degree that meant nothing because they couldn\\'t code their way out of a paper bag.', 'Countermeasures are already underway for sure. \\n\\nGptzero.me is one if anyone wants to use it. \\n\\nEnjoy being on the cusp and go forward with the deep knowledge that not all things online are real or accurate.

The idea that the percentage of brain usage for problem-solving increases as the need for survival decreases is an intriguing way to look at our evolution. It's true that as societies develop, they tend to free up more resources for individuals to focus on intellectual pursuits rather than just surviving.\\n\\nAs you mentioned, the ancient Greeks were able to make significant advancements in science, mathematics, and philosophy because they had the support of their society, which allowed them to focus their mental efforts on solving problems. Since then, human civilization has seen a continued increase in the availability of resources, information, and technology, allowing more people to spend their time on intellectual pursuits rather than just focusing on survival.\\n\\nAs we progress further, it's likely that we will continue to see a shift in the balance between the percentage of brain power used for survival versus problem-solving. Technological advancements, such as automation and artificial intelligence, may further decrease the need for humans to focus on survival-related tasks, freeing up even more mental capacity for problem-solving and creative thinking.\\n\\nIn this context, the human brain indeed becomes an increasingly valuable resource. As more people have the opportunity to devote their cognitive resources to solving problems, we can expect to see continued advancements in science, technology, and other fields. At the same time, it's important to remember that we are still part of the natural world and must maintain a balance between our intellectual pursuits and our role within the larger ecosystem.\\n\\nOverall, the future of human civilization may be characterized by the increasing importance of the human brain as a resource for problem-solving and creative thinking, with the potential to unlock new frontiers in knowledge and technology.\\n\\nPart 2:\\n\\nYour argument is an interesting perspective on the progression of human civilization and the role of education in unlocking human potential. It is true that as technology advances and survival becomes less of a concern, people can focus more on solving complex problems and making further advancements. This, in turn, leads to more innovations and improvements in quality of life.\\n\\nYou are correct in stating that the current education system may be antiquated and not optimized for fully utilizing human potential. It often emphasizes memorization and test-taking skills, rather than fostering creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. A revolution in the education system could indeed have a significant impact on the future of humanity.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can play a crucial role in this educational revolution. They can be used to create personalized learning experiences, making education more engaging and effective. Additionally, AI can help teachers identify and address individual student needs, allowing for better support and guidance.\\n\\nMoreover, AI and LLMs can facilitate access to high-quality educational resources for people around the world, reducing disparities in education and fostering a more equitable society. By bridging the gap between education and the ever-evolving demands of the modern world, AI can help unlock human potential on a global scale.\\n\\nAs we move towards a world where the human brain is valued as the most important resource, it is essential to invest in educational reforms and leverage AI and LLMs to foster a new generation of thinkers, innovators, and problem solvers. This revolution in education will be instrumental in shaping the future of humanity and realizing our full potential as a species.\", \"certainly there are many nuances to this topic in particular for different circumstances or subjects, but i guess what the point im getting at is that schools build a student's skills from the ground up in a society in which the endgoal is for you to obtain essentially a certain level of basic certification for jobs at a specialized field of work in private or public companies which are basically businesses trying to turn a profit, and students are expected to apply their knowledge in various ways to fit into that mold that the companies expect from them. whereas the kind of school i envision is where you simultaneously learn and apply your skills directly to the kinds of work of a company which can produce something tangible in the economy or doing research on the forefront of those niche industries which are then able to be adopted for real-world usage. either a research laboratory or real world work you can immediately see the impact of, but rather than from a workplace environment at the end of it all. essentially, a vertical integration of learning and academics directly into the workforce and private enterprise sectors of the world. i think AI can bridge the gap eventually. training to get to a certain job which might have taken 20-30 years from their first day in school might be compressed to 10-15 years if done right, because of the superior efficiency and optimization of targeted, AI-assisted, vertically integrated learning process. this would only be feasible in a certain point in our civilization however, when jobs are no longer required insomuch as to paying an individual to living or doing white-collar jobs that don't require much creativity or complex problem solving, active research work however. but ai will automate that part of the workforce so much that it should be adapted as such for humans to converge into that kind of learning basis. right now, the only access to these kinds of learning environments are already much to a degree being gated by institutions that grant you the privilege to such an endeavor, i.e. masters and post-doctorate studies, in universities like Stanford or MIT, etc. you see real-world applications for a lot of cutting edge technologies being built and invented in these places, which ought to be the basis for all educational curriculum, imho, but alas, we are not in such an age yet where that kind of highly selective academics is able to be widespread due to simply the costs associated with providing that framework for everyone.\\n\\nand of course, it wouldn't have been better summed up by chatGPT, so here it is:\\n\\nYour vision of a vertically integrated learning system, where education is directly tied to real-world applications and cutting-edge research, is indeed an ambitious and potentially transformative idea. The traditional model of education, which emphasizes obtaining certifications and degrees to secure specialized jobs, could be replaced with a more efficient, targeted, and hands-on approach, as you described.\\n\\nAI could play a vital role in facilitating this new form of education, by providing personalized learning experiences and accelerating the learning process. With the help of AI, students could quickly gain the necessary knowledge and skills to contribute to the economy or engage in cutting-edge research.\\n\\nAs you mentioned, the current higher education system, especially in prestigious institutions, already incorporates some aspects of this approach, with students often working on research projects and engaging in real-world applications of their knowledge. However, this approach is not yet widespread or accessible to all, mainly due to the costs and resources required.\\n\\nIn an era where AI has automated many jobs and reduced the need for human labor in certain sectors, it would be essential to adapt the education system to better prepare individuals for careers that require creativity and complex problem-solving skills. This would involve a significant shift in the way we approach education and could lead to more equitable access to high-quality learning experiences.\\n\\nBy integrating AI-assisted learning and real-world applications into the curriculum, we could create a new generation of thinkers and innovators who can contribute to the advancement of humanity. It is essential to invest in the development of such an education system and work towards making it accessible to everyone, to fully harness the potential of AI and create a brighter future for all.\", \"Yup.

There are some uses (as a kind of tutor or encyclopedia) which, if accuracy issues are ever resolved, seem innocuous and potentially positive. But the real crux of the issue is that humans think and express their thinking in language, and LLMs do an awful good job at presenting a facsimile of that. Here I think it's helpful to make an analogy to AI in games like Chess or Go. \\n\\nSuch AI can help people improve at those games, but only when used in certain ways: for feedback after a match, for example, or to study in preparation. If a player sits down and every time they play a game of Chess, they whip out their AI and do every move it tells them, they won't learn *nothing*, but they will learn a lot less and a lot more slowly than if they had just played the game themselves. They will probably never become very good.\\n\\nNow that won't matter very much if you don't care about getting good at Chess and you only care about winning, so the end goal matters a lot to whether we care about the impact it  would have to rely on Chess AI in this way.\\n\\nCircling back to education, what tools like ChatGPT is going to confront us with are questions about what kinds of thinking and communication skills are important for humans *themselves* to cultivate because we care about having the skills ourselves (we want to actually be good at Chess), and which thinking and communication skills aren't important for humans themselves to develop because we only care about outcomes (we want to win).\\n\\nThese questions are going to be complicated by the fact that unlike in the case of Chess, where there are clear-cut and objective criteria for 'winning' which allow us to see that AI are indeed reliable at helping us achieve that outcome, many human endeavors lack such a clear-cut equivalent.\\n\\nPeople are going to disagree a lot on which skills fall into what category. Even if we agree that certain skills are important, we then have to figure out how to educate for and assess them given that LLMs do such a good job at generating a facsimile. There are also going to be important questions about the contribution of education to those skills. At least for a while, no one can do the equivalent of having a Chess AI play every game for them. People will still, outside of education, run into situations where they need to use their reasoning and communication skills and will develop them to some extent in that way. I do think there is benefit to education, because often specialized, focus training in ways of applying these skills help accelerate their development in valuable ways and exposure to how others have thought about and developed those skills can be important for breaking people out of ruts and bad habits. \\n\\nThe one thing I wish people would do right now, though, is slow down. LLMs aren't just doing multiplication or spitting out facts. New technologies have the potential to cause a lot of disruption that isn't actually for the better.

It's why I always had to show my work in math class, because sometimes you can wrong your way into a right answer. It's why I like to see paper structures, bibliographies, and rough drafts. \\n\\nI can see your point, and personally it was one I always had issue with in Primary and Secondary education (the showing the work part), and while I understand the concern that you want to make sure that your students understand the topics your teaching them, the production of the work is not necessarily indicative of that. For example, I could write a 2 page paper on nuclear fission, but that paper in of itself does not indicate that I know what I'm talking about (just because I write it). The student can BS just as much as the AI can (from what we've seen at least), rather my stance on it is that the *content* the actual intent of their work is what matters.\\n\\nFor example, if there was a class on machine learning in 20 years, and students were asked to write papers on the origins of AI. If a student provided a histography of AI, just describing events, rather than tying them together or reaching any definitive conclusion in their work, there would be the question of did they learn anything other than the names and dates. Additionally, if someone else produced a paper that made wild conjectures or made a claim that wasn't well reasoned, then it should be questioned if they reviewed their work.

By the way the industry defines success, it's the most successful platform, outpacing by far Youtube and Facebook and Instagram. If it's banned, someone could leak TikTok, making it open-source overnight, but that wouldn't bring it back. It needs not just hosting and the ability to get around being blocked, but immense resources to function and additional resources to improve. The tool itself of TikTok, which is unique, can be destroyed. \\n\\nI've had discussions with several others regarding TikTok and in particularly it's similarity to YouTubeShorts. To address your points though, YouTubeShorts, in the general function, is identical to TikTok, it's primary difference being different platform and as it was produced later, less momentum. In business momentum is a big thing, whoever gets on the ball first tends to dominate, but without regulation, there are still allowed competitors and those competitors can still exist and thrive. I would additionally point out that TikTok (as opposed to Douyin in China) is available worldwide (outside of China), and it's banning in parts of the US does not necessitate its destruction.\\n\\n>   Now, look at OpenAI under the same lens. This is a unique AI which happened to get $1 billion from a group of ultra-wealthy investors. It ended up working in partnership with Microsoft, one of the most profitable tech companies in existence. Even being open-source, what we've seen so far is the use of vast wealth from investors for this to come into existence and to develop. \\n\\nWhile I disagree with the lens, I'll point out that GPT has already spawned off several competitors, many funded by the same people who initially funded OpenAI, additionally OpenAI isn't opensource (at least not now in any consideration) meaning there is more competition from *other* AIs to dominate the field of competition.\\n\\n> The issue in both of these is credit for the work. My work, in both of these cases, is the prompt and the prompt only. Beyond the content of that prompt, it's academic fraud to attribute the work to myself. \\n\\nI would strongly disagree, You have produced the prompt, yes, but that prompt has thus produced the work, so by A->B and B->C, A->C you've produced the work. The work would not have been produced without you, and it's content is entirely dependent upon you. You are responsible for what you generate with GPT, as much as you'd be responsible for the secondary consequences of any action.\\n\\n>  Can education have no responsibility to teach integrity even when it punishes a lack of integrity? Doesn't expelling a student for blatant plagiarism create deterrence for other students, thus creating incentive for academic honesty? \\n\\nI believe you're conflating two things I was trying to distinguish, the education system is not responsible for their students having integrity. It *ought* to only have students who have integrity. If students demonstrate a lack of it, they oughtn't be at the school, and thus expulsion is reasonable. Incentive's for integrity isn't the same thing as teaching integrity.\\n\\nBut I think the larger issue is that there's disagreement over whether using GPT qualifies as plagiarism and your last comment had indicated that I'm probably right in that assessment.\\n\\nI really do value these discussions, so thank you for engaging, hope you have a good week!\", 'Pretty much the same here.
